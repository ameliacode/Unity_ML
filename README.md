## Unity Machine Learning

Personal repo for applying Unity ML agents in practice based on **Learn Unity ML-agents, Fundamental of Unity Machine Learning**.    
***Notes..***  
The Tensorflow library they took is not the version(Tensorflow 2.0) we use today since 2020.  
Hence I gave a little twist to the content and decided to use Pytorch, as unity ml-agents new releases supports Pytorch instead of Tensorflow.  
I only took the idea from the book and hope this can be a great tutorial for newbies out there.
